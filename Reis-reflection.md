**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I'm still getting a grasp on the proper Git workflow when it comes to merging and deleting the branches. Do we need to delete the branch manually on the local repo once the branch is merged remotely?

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

I have a better idea on how commit messages should be formatted and worded now. 

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I asked questions about merging branches and how they operate remotely and locally. Additionally, I asked my guide about how to properly submit a Github URL.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

I'm  still a little shaky on understanding when to use the fetch commmands and how there can be two master branches at a time. I think recreating the issue in future scenarios will help because it was something I haven't encountered before.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was a little out of my comfort zone, but that's probably because I have little to no experience working this way. Over time, I think it will become easier once I get more accustomed to the driver and navigator roles, switching off and so forth.
